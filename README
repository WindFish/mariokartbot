This bot shall be able to play Mario Kart using the Mupen64Plus emulator.
It works both on Linux and on FreeBSD, but there are some differences:
	- under Linux, we can uinput to emulate a joystick. This works
	  with an existing mupen64plus installation, you just need to
	  create a suitable button mapping. currently, you can only create
	  it by uncommenting the code block with "press enter to steer left"
	  in mariokart.cpp.
	- under FreeBSD, you have to (and under Linux, you probably can)
	  use a patched version of the Mupen64Plus-SDL-Input-plugin.
	  Under FreeBSD, build mupen64plus from ports as usual, but then:
	  - cd into /usr/ports/emulators/mupen64plus-input-sdl/
	  - run 'make patch'
	  - cd work, and apply mupen64plus-input-sdl.patch from this repo
	  - cd .. and make install as usual
	  The input plugin will now create a FIFO/named pipe at 
	  /var/tmp/mupen64plus_ctl, which the bot writes to.
	  This does not affect normal gaming experience, the "external
	  control" only kicks in once the FIFO is written. Then, you cannot
	  use your "actual" controls any more.
	  
The program currently expects ~/MarioKart64.rom to be a valid
Mario Kart 64 ROM file which is playable by Mupen64Plus.
(Please note that it might be illegal to download the file from the
internet, and it definitely is illegal if you don't own the game AND
a N64. Don't do that.)

When you start ./mariokart, a Mupen64Plus instance is launched.
You have to navigate to a Time Trial with a suitable course (only
tested with Flower Cup -> Mario Raceway so far), start the game, and
wait for the small ghost to disappear. (You probably want to save the
state using F5 now; in future, you can get here quickly with F7).

Then press "ENTER" in the mariokart bot command window and enjoy :)
